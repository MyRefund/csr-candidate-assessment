# Customer Service Representative – Skills Assessment

Thanks for taking the time to complete this assessment.

This exercise reflects the type of situations you’d handle at My Refund. We’re not looking for perfect answers — we’re looking for clear communication, good judgment, accuracy, and a customer-first mindset.

⏱️ **Estimated time:** 20 minutes  
✍️ **How to respond:** Type your answers directly below each question  
🧠 **What we’re assessing:** Communication, empathy, prioritisation, compliance thinking, and attention to detail

## 1. Customer Email Response

You receive the following email from a customer:

> “This is the third time I’ve contacted you and I still don’t have an answer.  
> I was promised a response last week and now I’m being ignored.  
> If this isn’t sorted today, I’ll be taking this further.”

### Your task
Write a clear, professional, and empathetic response to the customer.

Focus on:
- Acknowledging their frustration  
- Taking ownership  
- Explaining next steps clearly

## 2. Prioritisation Scenario

You start your day and see the following items waiting for you:

1. A customer is upset about a delayed response and is threatening to escalate.
2. A customer has a quick question that would take around two minutes to answer.
3. An internal team member asks for help with a non-urgent task.
4. A customer reports they may have been charged twice.

### Your task
- List the order you would handle these (1–4)
- Briefly explain why you chose this order

## 3. Policy & Compliance – Identity Verification

A customer is completing their income tax return and needs to provide photo ID.

They send a message saying:

> “I don’t have a passport or driver licence, but I can send you my work ID instead.  
> I’ve used this for other things before and it should be fine.”

Company policy does **not** allow work ID to be accepted as valid identification.

The customer is polite, but clearly frustrated and wants to move forward quickly.

### Your task
Explain:
- What you would say to the customer
- How you would move the process forward while following policy

---

## 4. Empathy & Tone

A customer writes:

> “I know this probably isn’t your fault, but this whole process has been incredibly stressful and I’m really disappointed.”

### Your task
Write a short response (2–4 sentences) that:
- Acknowledges how the customer feels  
- Keeps the conversation calm and constructive

## 5. Attention to Detail

Please follow the instructions **exactly**:

1. Write the word **READY**
